# DelphiSpec

DelphiSpec is a library for running automated tests written in plain language. Because they're
written in plain language, they can be read by anyone on your team. Because they can be 
read by anyone, you can use them to help improve communication, collaboration and trust on
your team.

DelphiSpec was inspired by [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) and is using [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin/wiki).
